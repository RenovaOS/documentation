GovOS
=====
GovOS is a new operating system that seeks to reinvent operating systems from the ground up. Modern operating systems have largely been following the same basic standards since the early 90s and have only patched in new things as necessary. In the mean time, computers have changed tremendously and while many make very good attempts to keep up, they still have to maintain backwards compatibility. GovOS seeks to solve this problem by making a new set of standards that are not only designed for modern computers, but also are more sustainable for whatever computers the future may bring. This project is not here to tear down other operating systems but to rethink the standards for the future.

FAQ
---
###Why do this?
We believe that projects are not finished when they just "work". We believe a project is finished when it is done right. As a result, this project seeks to takes computers from just "working" to being done right and ready for the future.

###Will this project ever be finished?
Because of the nature of this project, we will likely not finish. We will work hard to get a set of standards and an operating system created, however we will always look for and make improvements to both the standards and the code.

###Isn't it a very large and ambitious project to create an operating system, especially from scratch?
Yes it is! We are creating it in parts, working largely on one at a time, and so while the completed OS will probably not be done for years, the project will still contribute parts of it that can be adapted to other operating systems and still acheive part of out goal.

###What if computers change in the next few years to something incompatible with your standards?
Well naturally, we fix the standards. We will try our hardest to prepare for the future but no one can think of everything and so if it turns out there is a problem, we will fix the standards and give one release with backwards compatiblity, if necessary.

###I'm starting to get excited! How can I help?
We are always eager to have new voices that can contribute very valuable insights to the project! The best ways to help are to either report new issues, possibly with patches to fix the problems, or to fork the repository and start contributing. The project is very strict on doing things right and so as a result, pull requests will go under a very tight review require a near unanimous acceptance from the team to be included. This isn't a discouragement to pull requests (we glady welcome them!) however it is to keep the codebase as clean and elegantly done as possible.
